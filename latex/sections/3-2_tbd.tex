\paragraph{Original generation and distribution}
\paragraph{Constructed encoding}
\paragraph{Uniformity and success rate}

We analyze the public key and ciphertext uniformity of our encoding and reduce to the two assumptions made above. We analyze the success rate of our encoding.

\begin{lemma}[[First-encaps Success Probability of TODO TBD]
\label{lem:tbd-first-encaps-success}
    TODO bounds on success
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Ciphertext Uniformity of TODO TBD]
\label{lem:tbd-ctxt-unif}
    TODO bounds on uniformity
\end{lemma}

Together with the TBD KEM, our encoding functions can be used to define a encapsulate-then-encode obfuscated KEM as in \cref{def:encaps-then-encode}.

\begin{theorem}[KEM Security of TODO TBD]
    Let TODO TBD be an encapsulate-then-encode obfuscated KEM based on the Classic McEliece KEM as per \cref{def:encaps-then-encode}. For any adversary $\adv$ against the $\indcca$ security of TODO TBD, there exists an algorithm $\bdv$ such that
    \[ \advantage{\indcca}{TODO TBD}[(\bdv)] \leq 123. \]

    Further,  For any adversary $\adv$ against the $\sprcca$ security of TODO TBD, there exists an algorithm $\bdv$ such that
    \[ \advantage{\sprcca}{TODO TBD}[(\bdv)] \leq 123. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    IND-CCA security follows from \cite[Theorem~2.12]{CCS:GunSteVei24}, together with \cref{lem:tbd-first-encaps-success}.
    
    SPR-CCA security follows from \cite[Theorem~2.13]{CCS:GunSteVei24}, together with \cref{lem:tbd-first-encaps-success,lem:tbd-ctxt-unif}.
\end{proof}
