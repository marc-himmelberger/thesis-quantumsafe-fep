\chapter{Obfuscating NIST candidates}\label{ch:obfuscation}

In this section, we expand the selection of available OKEMs for use in the \drivel{} protocol by analyzing post-quantum KEMs and constructing appropriate filter-encode obfuscators where needed.

Similar encodings have previously been constructed for the quantum-vulnerable elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman \cite{EC:vAhHop04,tor-dev-udh,USENIX:WWGH11,CCS:BHKL13,FC:Tibouchi14}, and recently also for the post-quantum ML-KEM \cite{fips203,CCS:GunSteVei24}.

Some other KEMs being examined for future use, incidentally, are ``natural'' OKEMs and require no further encodings. An example of this is FrodoKEM \cite{NISTPQC-R3:FrodoKEM20}, as discussed in \cite[Section~2.1]{EPRINT:GRSV25}, which we will also include when evaluating our implementation of \drivel{} later on.

We take a selection of two Round 4 candidates of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization \cite{nist-standardization}, Classic McEliece \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22} and HQC \cite{NISTPQC-R4:HQC22}, which (as far as we know) have not been shown to satisfy our definition of OKEMs before.

For each scheme, we describe the generation of public keys and ciphertexts in the original scheme and examine their distributions. We then introduce filter-encode obfuscators enabling a mapping from ciphertexts to uniformly random bit strings, if needed.
Finally, we give concrete bounds for the first-keygen success probabilities, first-encaps success probabilities and ciphertext uniformity of our constructions, which, together with the KEM's security properties, allows the corresponding instantiation of \drivel{} to achieve $\sObfKE$ security per \cref{cor:drivel-security-filter-encode}.

\Cref{tab:obfuscation-summary} summarizes previous work and the results of the later sections in this chapter for the context of \drivel{} (e.g. ignoring public key obfuscation).
