\chapter{Obfuscating NIST candidates}\label{ch:obfuscation}

In this section, we construct encodings for different post-quantum KEMs suitable for use in the pq-obfs protocol.

While such encodings have already been constructed for elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman \cite{CCS:BHKL13, tor-dev-udh, USENIX:WWGH11} as well as for ML-KEM \cite{CCS:GunSteVei24}, other KEMs are also being examined for future use.

TODO: Also cite 64, 62 from Obfuscated Key Exchange? Cite by name?

We take a selection of round 4 candidates of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization, as well as previous candidate schemes which we believe to be of interest.
For each scheme, we describe the generation of public keys and ciphertexts in the original scheme and examine their distributions. We then introduce encoding algorithms from the original public keys and ciphertexts to bitstrings and finally give concrete bounds for uniformity and encoding success rate.

We call all our encoding schemes TODO where TODO is the name of the corresponding KEM. \cref{tab:obfuscation-summary} summarizes the result of the later sections.

\section{Obfuscating Classic McEliece with TODO} \label{sec:obfuscating-classic-mceliece}

\paragraph{Original Generation and Distribution}
Classic McEliece \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22} is a code-based KEM in round 4 of the NIST PQC standardization. We only consider the so-called "non-f" versions of the specified parameter sets which are interoperable with the f versions, and have simpler but slower key generation. TODO: OK? Keita also makes that assumption at some point.

In Classic McEliece, public keys are the $k$ rightmost columns of a $mt \times n$ generator matrix in systematic form ($k = n - mt$). Ciphertexts are the $mt$ data bits corresponding to $n$-bit codewords with Hamming weight exactly $t$.

The generation of public keys occurs in a multistep process starting from a 256-bit seed which is expanded using SHAKE256 into a secondary seed and raw values. If the raw values do not form a suitable systematic code, another attempt is started from the secondary seed, and so on.

For encapsulation, rejection-sampling is used to generate a uniformly random vector of Hamming weight $t$ which is then mapped from the space of $n$-bit vectors to $mt=n-k$ bits.

We define the same assumptions about computational hardness as in \cite[Definition~K.1]{EC:Xagawa22}. \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions} shows corresponding game-based definitions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PR-Key assumption:} It is computationally hard to distinguish real public keys from the rightmost columns of the systematic forms of uniformly random generator matrices (conditional on the systematic form existing).
    \item \textbf{modified Decisional Syndrome Decoding assumption:} It is computationally hard to distinguish real ciphertexts from uniformly random $(n-k)$-bit vectors.
\end{itemize}

For both games $\textsf{goal} \in \{\prkey, \mdsd\}$, we define the advantage of an adversary $\adv$ as follows and further say that Classic McEliece is $(t, \epsilon)\textsf{-goal}$-secure if for any adversary $\adv$ with running time at most $t$, we have that:
\[ \advantage{\textsf{goal}}{}[(\adv)] := 2 \cdot \Pr[\textsf{goal}(\adv) = 1] - 1 \leq \epsilon \]

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Indistinguishability games for Classic McEliece with $\kgen$ and \textsf{FixedWeight} as defined in \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22}. These follow the definitions from \cite[Definition~K.1]{EC:Xagawa22}.}
    \label{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Constructed Encoding}

Given the $\prkey$ assumption, public keys are hard to distinguish from outputs of $\textsf{RandGen}()$. On \cref{ln:randgen-reject}, a reduction to systematic form (also known as \emph{reduced row echelon form} or \emph{row canonical form}) fails if and only if the $mt$ leftmost columns of $\hat H$ do not form a full rank square matrix.
The probability for a $mt \times mt$ matrix with i.i.d. uniformly random entries over $\mathbb F_2$ to be of full rank is exactly \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SalmondGGC14}
\[ p_\textsf{FR} := \prod_{i=1}^{mt} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right) \approx 0.288788 \]

The above approximation holds for all parameter sets of Classic McEliece. We have $768 \leq mt \leq 1664$, and the function converges rapidly. A strict upper bound of $p_\textsf{FR} \leq \prod_{i=1}^{768} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right) \leq \prod_{i=1}^{8} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right) \leq 0.29$ can be shown. The proof for a tight lower bound eludes us.

We now show a simplification of $\textsf{RandGen}()$ which produces statistically indistinguishable results.

\begin{lemma}[Simplifying \textsf{RandGen}] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-randgen-prime}
    Let $\textsf{RandGen}(), \textsf{RandGen}'()$ be defined as in \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions}.
    The distributions $D_0 = \{ M \gets \textsf{RandGen}() \}$ and $D_1 = \{ M \gets \textsf{RandGen}'() \}$ are statistically indistinguishable, i.e. have statistical distance $\Delta(D_0, D_1) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Consider an intermediate value of $\hat H$ which can be reduced to systematic form (i.e. has full rank). This value exists for all terminating executions of $\textsf{RandGen}()$ as the last sample drawn before returning.

    In general, the reduced row echelon form is obtained using Gauss–Jordan elimination. This algorithm carries out a sequence of operations on the matrix consisting of swapping rows, adding rows onto others and scaling rows.
    Over $\mathbb F_2$, the scaling of rows is not needed and swapping of rows can be accomplished via a sequence of 3 row additions. The reduction can thus be expressed as merely a sequence of adding rows onto others.
    The systematic form of $\hat H$ over $\mathbb F_2$, just like reduced row echelon forms over any field, is also unique. Thus it suffices to consider an arbitrary sequence of row additions transforming $\hat H$ to systematic form.
    
    The leftmost $mt$ columns of $\hat H$ suffice to determine which rows are added to which others.
    Let $M_0$ denote the rightmost columns of $\hat H$, which form a $mt \times k$ matrix of uniformly random i.i.d. entries from $\mathbb F_2$, independent from the leftmost columns of $\hat H$. As the addition of any one row of uniformly random bits onto any other row of independent uniformly random bits produces a row of uniformly random i.i.d. bits, the resulting matrix, say $M_1$, after one row addition of a randomly determined row onto another is statistically indistinguishable from $M_0$.
    
    Applying this argument for a maximum of $(mt)^2$ times, we can conclude that $\hat T$ is statistically indistinguishable from a uniformly random $mt \times k$ matrix over $\mathbb F_2$.
\end{proof}

Ciphertexts are already hard to distinguish from uniform random bit vectors following the $\mdsd$ assumption. We therefore only need to take care to pad the bit vectors up to the byte boundary with randomly sampled bits that can be discarded during decoding. This is necessary only for the parameter set 'mceliece6960119' as all others have $mt = 0 \mod 8$.

\cref{fig:classic-mceliece-encoding} shows the encoding functions for TODO TBD in pseudocode.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Uniformity and Success Rate}

We analyze the public key and ciphertext uniformity of our encoding and reduce to the two assumptions made above. We analyze the success rate of our encoding.

\begin{lemma}[Public key uniformity of TODO TBD] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-pk-unif}
    TODO bounds on uniformity
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Ciphertext uniformity of TODO TBD] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-ctxt-unif}
    TODO bounds on uniformity
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[First-keygen success probability of TODO TBD] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-first-keygen-success}
    TODO bounds on success
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[[First-encap success probability of TODO TBD] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-first-encap-success}
    TODO bounds on success
\end{lemma}

Together with the Classic McEliece KEM, our encoding functions can be used to define a keygen/encapsulate-then-encode obfuscated KEM as in \cref{def:keygen-then-encode} and \ref{def:keygen-encap-then-encode}.

\begin{theorem}
    Let TODO TBD be a keygen/encapsulate-then-encode obfuscated KEM based on the Classic McEliece KEM as per \cref{def:keygen-then-encode} and \ref{def:keygen-encap-then-encode}. For any adversary $\adv$ against the $\indcca$ security of TODO TBD, there exists an algorithm $\bdv$ such that
    \[ \advantage{\indcca}{TODO TBD}[(\bdv)] \leq 123 \]

    Further,  For any adversary $\adv$ against the $\sprcca$ security of TODO TBD, there exists an algorithm $\bdv$ such that
    \[ \advantage{\sprcca}{TODO TBD}[(\bdv)] \leq 123 \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    IND-CCA security follows from \cite[Theorem~2.12]{CCS:GunSteVei24}, together with \cref{lem:classic-mceliece-first-keygen-success} and \ref{lem:classic-mceliece-first-encap-success}.
    
    SPR-CCA security follows from \cite[Theorem~2.13]{CCS:GunSteVei24}, together with \cref{lem:classic-mceliece-first-keygen-success}, \ref{lem:classic-mceliece-first-encap-success} and \ref{lem:classic-mceliece-ctxt-unif}.
\end{proof}
