\chapter{Obfuscating NIST candidates}\label{ch:obfuscation}

In this section, we construct encodings for different post-quantum KEMs suitable for use in the pq-obfs protocol.

While such encodings have already been constructed for elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman \cite{CCS:BHKL13, tor-dev-udh, USENIX:WWGH11} as well as for ML-KEM \cite{CCS:GunSteVei24}, other KEMs are also being examined for future use.

TODO: Also cite 64, 62 from Obfuscated Key Exchange? Cite by name?

We take a selection of round 4 candidates of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization, as well as previous candidate schemes which we believe to be of interest.
For each scheme, we describe the generation of public keys and ciphertexts in the original scheme and examine their distributions. We then introduce encoding algorithms from the original public keys and ciphertexts to bitstrings and finally give concrete bounds for uniformity and encoding success rate.

We call all our encoding schemes TODO where TODO is the name of the corresponding KEM. \cref{tab:obfuscation-summary} summarizes the result of the later sections.

TODO: Show domain in table? Update references to convenience definitions earlier.

\section{Obfuscating Classic McEliece with TODO} \label{sec:obfuscating-classic-mceliece}

\paragraph{Original Generation and Distribution}
Classic McEliece \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22} is a code-based KEM in round 4 of the NIST PQC standardization. We only consider the so-called "non-f" versions of the specified parameter sets which are interoperable with the f versions, and have simpler but slower key generation. TODO: OK? Keita also makes that assumption at some point.

In Classic McEliece, public keys are the rightmost column of a generator matrix in systematic form. Ciphertexts are the data bits corresponding to codewords with Hamming weight exactly $t$.

The generation of public keys occurs in a multi-step process starting from a 256-bit seed which is expanded using SHAKE256 into a secondary seed and raw values. If the raw values do not form a suitable systematic code, another attempt is started from the secondary seed, and so on.

For encapsulation, rejection-sampling is used to generate a uniformly random vector of Hamming weight $t$ which is then mapped from the space of $n$-bit vectors to $mt=n-k$ bits.

We define the same assumptions about computational hardness as in \cite[Definition~K.1]{EC:Xagawa22}. \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions} shows corresponding game-based definitions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PR-Key assumption:} It is computationally hard to distinguish real public keys from the rightmost columns of the systematic forms of uniformly random generator matrices (conditional on the systematic form existing). \\
    Consequently, no adversary $\adv$ could achieve high $ \advantage{\prkey}{}[(\adv)] $.
    \item \textbf{modified Decisional Syndrome Decoding assumption:} It computationally hard to distinguish real ciphertexts from uniformly random $(n-k)$-bit vectors. \\
    Consequently, no adversary $\adv$ could achieve high $ \advantage{\mdsd}{}[(\adv)] $.
\end{itemize}
