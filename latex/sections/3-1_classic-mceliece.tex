\section{Classic McEliece as an Obfuscated KEM} \label{sec:obfuscating-classic-mceliece}

Throughout this \cref{sec:obfuscating-classic-mceliece}, we use the positive integer variables $m,n,t,k$ where $n < 2^m$ and $k=mt-n$ as defined in \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22}. We work with matrices and vectors over $\mathbb F_2$ when examining the KEM and use bitstrings in the defintion and analysis of OKEMs. As the dimensions of the matrices and vectors are fixed for a given parameter set, we associate the matrices and vectors with their canonical encoding as bitstrings of appropriate length.

\paragraph{Original generation and distribution}
Classic McEliece \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22} is a perfectly correct, code-based KEM in Round 4 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization \cite{nist-standardization}. Although NIST announced in early 2025 that Classic McEliece would not be standardized as part of this process \cite{nist-ir-8545}. We only consider the so-called "non-f" versions of the specified parameter sets which are interoperable with the f versions, and have simpler but slower key generation.

In Classic McEliece, public keys are the $k$ rightmost columns of a $mt \times n$ generator matrix in systematic form ($k = n - mt$). Ciphertexts are the $mt$ data bits corresponding to $n$-bit codewords with Hamming weight exactly $t$.

The generation of public keys is a multistep process starting from a 256-bit seed which is expanded using SHAKE256 into a secondary seed and raw values. If the raw values do not form a suitable systematic code, another attempt is started from the secondary seed, and so on. This key generation process, among other algorithms from the Round 4 specification of Classic McEliece are reproduced in \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-spec}.

For encapsulation, rejection-sampling is used to generate a uniformly random vector of Hamming weight exactly $t$ which is then mapped from the space of $n$-bit vectors to $mt=n-k$ bits using the generator matrix defined by the public key.

For the sake of brevity, the many more technical details, as well as the semi-systematic form, are omitted.}
    \label{fig:classic-mceliece-spec}
\end{figure}

We define the same assumptions about computational hardness as in \cite[Definition~K.1]{EC:Xagawa22}. These have appeared in more general forms in previous literature studying the Niederreiter and McEliece cryptosystems, e.g. \cite{AC:CouFinSen01,EC:SaiXagYam18}. \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions} shows corresponding game-based definitions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PR-Key assumption:} It is computationally hard to distinguish real public keys from the rightmost columns of the systematic forms of uniformly random generator matrices (conditioned on the systematic form existing).
    \item \textbf{modified Decisional Syndrome Decoding ($\mdsd$) assumption:} It is computationally hard to distinguish ciphertexts generated using uniformly random generator matrices from uniformly random $(n-k)$-bit vectors.
\end{itemize}

For both games $\mathsf{goal} \in \{\prkey, \mdsd\}$, we define the advantage of an adversary $\adv$ against these games as
\[
    \advantage{\mathsf{goal}}{}[(\adv)]
    := 2 \cdot \left| \Pr\left[\mathsf{goal}(\adv) \Rightarrow 1\right] - \frac{1}{2} \right|
    \leq \epsilon.
\]

\paragraph{Classic McEliece has uniformly random public keys}
Although we do not require uniformly random encodings of public keys for this thesis, we believe to have found an equivalent but simplified form of the $\prkey$ assumption, that we found worthy of inclusion.

Given the $\prkey$ assumption, public keys are computationally hard to distinguish from outputs of $\textsf{RandGen}()$. We claim that $\textsf{RandGen}()$ can be simplified to a new algorithm $\textsf{RandGen}'()$, also shown in \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions}, with statistical indistinguishability between these two algorithms. This claim would imply computational indistinguishability between Classic McEliece's public keys and the outputs of $\textsf{RandGen}'()$.

\begin{lemma}[Simplifying \textsf{RandGen}] \label{lem:classic-mceliece-randgen-prime}
    Let $\textsf{RandGen}(), \textsf{RandGen}'()$ be defined as in \cref{fig:classic-mceliece-assumptions}.
    The distributions $D_0 = \{ \hat T \gets \textsf{RandGen}() \}$ and $D_1 = \{ \hat T \gets \textsf{RandGen}'() \}$ are statistically indistinguishable, i.e. have statistical distance $\Delta(D_0, D_1) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We first examine the rejection sampling behavior around \cref{ln:randgen-reject}: A resampling occurs if and only if a reduction of $\hat H$ to systematic form (also known as \emph{reduced row echelon form} or \emph{row canonical form}) fails. This reduction, in turn, fails if and only if the $mt$ leftmost columns of $\hat H$ do not form a full rank square matrix.
    The probability for a $mt \times mt$ matrix with i.i.d. uniformly random entries over $\mathbb F_2$ to be of full rank is exactly~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SalmondGGC14}
    \[ p_\mathsf{FR} := \prod_{i=1}^{mt} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right). \]
    
    For the parameter sets used in Classic McEliece ($768 \leq mt \leq 1664$), this is \[ p_\mathsf{FR} \approx 0.288788 . \]
    Differences between the parameter sets are negligible and a strict upper bound of $p_\mathsf{FR} \leq \prod_{i=1}^{768} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right) \leq \prod_{i=1}^{8} \left( 1-2^{-i} \right) \leq 0.29$ applies. A proof for a tight lower bound eludes us although the numerical convergence is rapid.
    
    This calculation further supports our statement that resampling occurs exactly for values of $\hat H$ whose $mt$ leftmost columns are not full rank, because the resulting probability $p_\mathsf{FR}$ is the same as was experimentally reported in \cite[security.pdf: Section 4.2]{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22}.
    
    After understanding which reductions fail, we now consider the possible influence that the reduction to systematic form might have on the distribution of bits in the simulated public key $\hat T$.

    Consider an intermediate value of $\hat H$ which can be reduced to systematic form (i.e. has full rank in its leftmost columns and will thus pass the check on \cref{ln:randgen-reject}). This value exists precisely once for all terminating executions of $\textsf{RandGen}()$ as the last $\hat H$ sampled before returning a result.

    In general, the reduced row echelon form can be obtained using Gaussâ€“Jordan elimination. This algorithm carries out a sequence of operations on the matrix consisting of swapping rows, adding rows onto others and scaling rows.
    Over $\mathbb F_2$, the scaling of rows is not needed and swapping of rows can be accomplished via a sequence of 3 row additions. Any Gauss-Jordan reduction to systematic form can thus be expressed as merely a sequence of row additions.
    The systematic form of $\hat H$ over $\mathbb F_2$, just like reduced row echelon forms over any field, is also unique. Thus it suffices to consider an arbitrary sequence of row additions transforming $\hat H$ to systematic form.

    Note in particular, that during such a sequence of row additions, the row rank of $\hat H$ must be preserved, as the systematic form has full row rank. It is thus impossible for the sequence to ever add any row onto itself, i.e. all row additions must be between distinct rows. Any addition of a row onto itself would lower the rank by 1 and, trivially, no row addition can increase the rank of a matrix.
    
    Due to the number of rows, a reduction is possible in at most $(mt)^2$ row additions: The diagonal can be filled with ones using at most $mt$ additions. After another $(mt)^2-mt$ additions at the latest, all other entries in the leftmost $mt$ columns are zeroes. To determine one such order of row additions which bring $\hat H$ into systematic form, it suffices to consider only the leftmost $mt$ columns.
    
    Let $M_0$ denote the rightmost columns of $\hat H$, which form a $mt \times k$ matrix of (by definition) uniformly random i.i.d. entries from $\mathbb F_2$, in particular, independent from the leftmost columns of $\hat H$.
    
    As the addition of any one row of uniformly random bits onto any other row of independent uniformly random bits produces a row of uniformly random i.i.d. bits, the resulting matrix after one row addition, say $M_1$, is statistically indistinguishable from $M_0$.
    
    Repeating this argument for a maximum of $(mt)^2$ times, we can conclude that $\hat T$ is statistically indistinguishable from a uniformly random $mt \times k$ matrix over $\mathbb F_2$ as in $\textsf{RandGen}'()$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Classic McEliece is already obfuscated}
We now return to our examination of ciphertext uniformity in Classic McEliece.

Ciphertext uniformity follows directly from the $\prkey$ and $\mdsd$ assumptions, and we show this reduction, and thus computational indistinguishability from uniformly random bit vectors below. Additionally, implementers should note that padding public keys and ciphertexts to the byte boundary may require \emph{randomized} padding. This is only needed if the number of bits is not evenly divisible by 8, and occurs only for the parameter set ``mceliece6960119''.  All other parameter sets have $mt = 0 \mod 8$. Padding of these values with zero bits (as suggested in the Classic McEliece specification) would trivially break the desired ciphertext uniformity.

As we require no KEM encoding to achieve ciphertext uniformity, there is no need to discuss first-encaps success probability.

\begin{lemma}[Ciphertext uniformity of Classic McEliece]
\label{lem:classic-mceliece-ctxt-unif}
    Let $\mathsf{CM}$ be the obfuscated KEM defined by the Classic McEliece specification \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22} with obfuscated ciphertext length $\obfctxtlen = n-k$.
    
    For any adversary $\adv$ against the ciphertext uniformity of $\mathsf{CM}$, there exist adversaries $\bdv, \cdv$ against the $\prkey$ and $\mdsd$ assumptions respectively, such that
    \[
        \advantage{\ctxtunif}{\mathsf{CM}}[(\adv)]
        \leq 2 \cdot \left(
            \advantage{\prkey}{}[(\bdv)] + \advantage{\mdsd}{}[(\cdv)]
        \right).
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This follows directly from \cref{lem:ctxt-unif-for-bijections} because we can define $\encodectxt: \mathcal{C} \to \bin^\obfctxtlen$ to simply map vectors to their canonical representation as bitstrings. This encoding function is deterministic, bijective and never fails, i.e. $\epsilon^\firstencapssuccess_{\mathsf{CM},\encodectxt} = 1$.

    A reduction from $\sprcca$ with $\simulunif$ to the $\prkey$ and $\mdsd$ assumptions is given in \cite[Theorem~K.1]{EC:Xagawa22}.


    We proceed via a series of two game hops, and consider the following three games:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $G_0$ denote the $\ctxtunif$ game as in \cref{def:ctxt-uniformity}
        \item Let $G_1$ denote the same game as $G_0$ but with the change that $\pk$ is generated using $\textsf{RandGen}()$
        \item Let $G_2$ denote the same game as $G_1$ but with the change that $\hat c_0 \getsr \bin^\obfctxtlen$, i.e. both ciphertexts are uniformly random bitstrings
    \end{itemize}

    As $G_0$ denotes the original $\ctxtunif$ game, we have
    \[
        2 \cdot \left|
            \Pr\left[G_0(\adv) \Rightarrow 1\right] - \frac{1}{2}
        \right|
        = \advantage{\ctxtunif}{\mathsf{CM}}[(\adv)].
    \]

    To bound the difference in advantage between $G_0$ and $G_1$, notice that we can define an adversary $\bdv$ against the $\prkey$ as follows:
    Let $b$ denote the bit from the $\prkey$ game. Let $\bdv$ then be a reduction which samples a uniformly random bit $b'$ and (using the public key received from its $\prkey$ challenger) simulates the $\ctxtunif$ games towards $\adv$. Thus, if $b'=0$, then $\adv$ receives a ciuphertext output by $\encaps(\pk)$ and if $b'=1$, $\adv$ receives a randomly sampled bitstring.
    Let $b''$ denote the subsequent output of $\adv$.
    Finally, let $\bdv$ output its guess for the bit $b$ in the $\prkey$ game as $b=1$ if and only if $\adv$ wins the simulated game, i.e. $b'' = b'$.

    Therefore, if $b=0$ in the $\prkey$ game, then $\adv$ is playing in $G_0$, if $b=1$, then $\adv$ is playing in $G_1$.
    And any change in the probability of $\adv$ winning in $G_0$ vs $G_1$ directly corresponds to a change in the probability of $\bdv$ winning the $\prkey$ game. 

    We can conclude that
    \begin{align*}
        \left|
            \Pr\left[G_0(\adv) \Rightarrow 1 \right] - \Pr\left[G_1(\adv) \Rightarrow 1 \right]
        \right|
        &= 
        \left|
            \Pr\left[b''=b' \mid b=0 \right] - \Pr\left[b''=b' \mid b=1 \right]
        \right| \\
        &= \advantage{\prkey}{}[(\bdv)],
    \end{align*}
    where the first equality follows from the fact that $\bdv$ perfectly simulates the two games and $b$ determines which game $\adv$ plays, and the second equality is standard advantage rewriting.

    The analogous argument applies to the switch from $G_1$ to $G_2$: Let $b$ denote the bit from the $\mdsd$ game. We define an adversary $\cdv$ against the $\mdsd$ assumption which receives a public key from $\textsf{RandGen}()$ and a real-or-random ciphertext $u$. Let $\cdv$ then sample a new uniformly random bit $b'$ and forward to $\adv$ the received public key along with $u$, if $b'=0$, or along with a new bitstring, sampled uniformly at random, if $b'=1$.
    Let $\cdv$ output a guess that $b=1$ if and only if $\adv$ ouputs $b'$.
    
    Then, $\cdv$ perfectly simulates simulates one of two variants of the $\ctxtunif$ game towards $\adv$: If $b=0$ in the $\mdsd$ game, then $\adv$ is playing in $G_1$, if $b=1$, then $\adv$ is playing in $G_2$ (note that we translate in the obvious way between vectors of bits and bitstrings of the appropriate length). Thus,
    \[
        \left|
            \Pr\left[G_1(\adv) \Rightarrow 1 \right] - \Pr\left[G_2(\adv) \Rightarrow 1 \right]
        \right|
        = \advantage{\mdsd}{}[(\cdv)].
    \]

    And finally, because both $\hat c_0$ and $\hat c_1$ are independent and uniformly random bitstrings in game $G_2$,
    \[
        \left|
            \Pr\left[G_2(\adv) \Rightarrow 1\right] - \frac{1}{2}
        \right|
        = 0.
    \]

    Combining the above inequalities using the triangle inequality yields
    \[
        \left|
            \Pr\left[G_0(\adv) \Rightarrow 1 \right] - \frac{1}{2}
        \right|
        \leq \advantage{\prkey}{}[(\bdv)] + \advantage{\mdsd}{}[(\cdv)] + 0,
    \]
    which directly implies the required bound after a multiplication by two on both sides.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Security of Classic McEliece}

We have seen that Classic McEliece, as specified in \cite{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22}, is an obfuscated KEM without requiring any special encoding of ciphertexts. Additionally, Classic McEliece satisfies the required KEM security notions:

\begin{theorem}[$\indcca$ and $\sprcca$ of Classic McEliece]
    Classic McEliece, as a KEM, achieves $\indcca$ and $\sprcca$ security.
    $\sprcca$ security holds with respect to the simulator $\simulunif$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The $\indcca$ and $\sprcca$ security notions for KEMs defined in \cref{def:kem-security} match the established notions for KEMs of the same names. These have been shown for Classic McEliece in previous work \cite{EC:Xagawa22}, and \cite[security.pdf: Section 5]{NISTPQC-R4:ClassicMcEliece22}.
\end{proof}

However, because we need
